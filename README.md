notes:
1. Do not use the MATAM folder, it's convoluted for no reason. use ex1 which is easier to use. In resources you can find the supplied files, while in code you can find the stuff we are currently working on.
2. map.c is pretty similar to what appeared in the slideshows, so we should change it (shouldn't be literally verbatim).
3. Idea for implementing map:
Use nodes containing pointers to the prev and next nodes, a key element and it's respective data element.
